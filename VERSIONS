The pillar versioning scheme
============================

The versioninig scheme described below is applied starting with 0.6 release.

The Pillar version consists of 3 components: major, minor, and build. Major and 
minor releases have the conventional semantic: major release is a regular
release, and minor release contains hotfixes. 

Major release can use any number between 1 and infnity. Special major number of
0 is used to denote beta and alpha builds.

For each major release, minor release is 0. Hotfix increments the minor digit
by 1. There can be up to 9 hotfixes. 

Build versions are zero-padded integers starting with 0 for every major
release. These are used for internal purposes, and should not be released. Each
build version > 0 should be treated as a development version for the next major
release.

Examples:

    0.7.000 - 7th beta version.
    1.0.000 - first major release
    1.1.000 - first hotfix rlease for first major release
    2.8.000 - 8th hotfix for second major release
    3.0.002 - second development build for 4th major release.
